 Sarah Lawson is a 46-year-old female who presented to the rheumatology clinic with
 symptoms consistent with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). She has a known history of RA,
 diagnosed 5 years ago, but has recently experienced increased joint pain and swelling,
 particularly in her wrists and knees.

 Diagnosis:
 Rheumatoid Arthritis
 Osteoarthritis
 Clinical Findings:

 On examination, Sarah had moderate swelling and tenderness in both wrists and knees.
 Her range of motion is slightly limited in the affected joints, and there was evidence of mild
 synovitis. Her ESR was raised at 45mm/hr, and CRP was elevated at 32mg/L, suggesting
 ongoing inflammation.

 Her previous medications for RA included methotrexate 15mg weekly and
 hydroxychloroquine 200mg daily. There were no signs of adverse effects from these
 treatments, but Sarah expressed concerns about her recent flare-up and increased pain.

 Family History:

 Sarah's mother has a history of osteoarthritis, and her father was diagnosed with RA at age
 52. There is no known family history of other autoimmune disorders.

 Our plan today includes to continue with the current methotrexate regimen, but increase the
 dose to 20mg weekly to better control the inflammation.

 Keep hydroxychloroquine at 200mg daily, as she has tolerated it well without side effects.

 Initiate a short course of oral prednisolone 20mg daily for 2 weeks to manage the current
 flare and reduce inflammation.

 Monitor her liver function and blood counts regularly due to the increased methotrexate
 dose.

 Sarah has been advised to continue with physiotherapy and joint protection strategies to
 manage symptoms. We discussed the potential side effects of the medications, particularly
 the increased dose of methotrexate, and she is to contact us if she experiences any
 unusual symptoms such as mouth ulcers or fatigue.

 Sarah will be seen in 4 weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess her response to the
 new treatment plan. If her symptoms do not improve, we may consider adding a biologic
 agent.

 Please continue with her routine monitoring, and let us know if any concerns arise.
 Sincerely,
 Dr. Harry Melvin
