 Procedure Comments

 OGD for dilatation of an oesophageal stricture thought to
 be benign. Previously dilated to 12mm in April 2024. On
 Lansoprazole BD. There remained a non-traversable lower
 oesophageal stricture at 35 cm from the incisors. This was
 balloon dilated incrementally from 10 mm to 12 mm. I was
 then able to traverse it. The stricture did look ulcerated. I
 did not biopsy it as I was under the impression it had
 previously been sampled but after the procedure I realised
 there were no biopsies taken previously. He should
 continue BD Lansoprazole. I have requested a repeat OGD
 to be done in 4 weeks ? further dilatation + take biopsies.
